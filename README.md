# ImageSharingApp Project

Goal: a robust, scalable REST API for an image-sharing application using the Express framework for Node.js to interact with the MongoDB database to fetch and store data.  The API will handle image uploads, allowing users to create image posts with optional captions or descriptions. 

Client side: Users will be able to register, log in, create image posts, and update their own posts. After registering, users will be able to manage their username, email, and profile picture.
